# /02 - Vertex AI AutoML/readme.md

This series of notebooks will introduce [Vertex AI AutoML](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/start/automl-model-types) with a focus on Tabular data Classification Methods.

Vertex AI AutoML accelerate the workflow of creating an ML model by preprocessing the data and choosing model architectures for you, even testing multiple and creating ensembles to achieve a best model.  This is available for ML models on text, image, video, and tabular data.  

**Prerequisites**
- [00 - Setup.ipynb](../00%20-%20Setup/00%20-%20Environment%20Setup.ipynb)
- [01 - BigQuery - Table Data Source.ipynb](../01%20-%20Data%20Sources/01%20-%20BigQuery%20-%20Table%20Data%20Source.ipynb)

## Notebooks: 
This list is in the suggest order of review for anyone getting an overview and learning about Vertex AI AutoML.  It is also ok to pick a particular notebook of interest and if there are dependencies on prior notebooks they will be listed in the **prerequisites** section at the top of the notebook.

>The notebooks are designed to be editable for trying with other data sources.  The same parameter names are used across the notebooks to also help when trying multiple methods on a custom data source.
